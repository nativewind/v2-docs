# Responsive Design

:::caution
NativeWind's default theme is not yet designed for native devices and still uses breakpoints that were mostly designed for web.
:::

NativeWind's responsive design works identically to Tailwind CSS, please refer to the [official Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) for more information.
