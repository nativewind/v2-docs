## Contributors

We are looking for contributors for the following:

### feat: transform-origin

Please support this [React Native Pull Request](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37606)

### originX / originY

`react-native-reanimated` supports `originX`/`originY`. We could support these properties until React Native gets proper support.
