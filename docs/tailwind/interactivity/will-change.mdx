### Add `will-change-transform`

When a component has a transition or animation class name it will use `react-native-reanimated`'s `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()` to make the component animated. If these class names are conditional, this will cause the component to unmount as NativeWind will conditionally render two different components.

A proposed solution is to use `will-change-transform` to force the component to be animated, even if not required.
