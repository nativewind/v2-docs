Tailwindcss requires a `tailwind.config.js` file with the content section configured to include the paths to all of your components and any other source files that contain Tailwind class names.

If you are not already familiar with Tailwind CSS, we recommend reading its [configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)

You will need to customise `content` to match your project's folder structure.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./screens/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  // ...
};
```
