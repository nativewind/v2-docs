Universally supported SVG's are possible through libraries such as [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg). While these docs use `react-native-svg`, the concept applies to all libraries.

Using the `classProp` option of `styled()`, `react-native-svg` components can be universally styled.
